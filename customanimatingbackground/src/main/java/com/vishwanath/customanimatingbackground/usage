0.Initialize the gradient builder, animator by calling
" CustomBackground.initialize(<view>) "

1.To set only a gradient background

a) create a gradient like

 -> var gradientResult = CustomBackground.setGradientViewFor(
    <view>,
    <GradientDrawable.Orientation>,
    <start color:String>,
    <middle color:String>,
    <end color:String>,
    <corner radius:Float>)

b) set it as a background to whichever view you want like

 -> <view>.background=gradientResult


 2. To set an animated background with a list of drawables

 i) WITH GRADIENT DRAWABLES

 a) create a list of Drawables like
     var animationDrawablesList = arrayListOf<Drawable>()

 b) create as many gradients as you want like in the above step 1.(b) and add them to the ' animationDrawablesList '

 or

 b) create as many objects of AnimationDrawableListItem  like

  var animList = AnimationDrawableListItem(
              main,
              GradientDrawable.Orientation.BOTTOM_TOP,
              "#D81B60",
              "#00574B",
              "#008577",
              0.0f
          )

  and add them to the ' animationDrawablesList '

 c) Set the animation list with the duration of your liking like
    CustomBackground.setAnimationList(animationDrawableList, 5000)

 d) Set animation on the view with transition duration of your liking like
    CustomBackground.setAnimation(<view>, 2500)

 ii) WITH PRE EXISTING DRAWABLE IMAGES

 a) create a list of Drawables like
      var animationDrawablesList = arrayListOf<Drawable>()

  b) add the drawables/images of your choice to the ' animationDrawablesList ' like
    getDrawable(R.drawable.dr_two)?.let { animationDrawableList.add(it) }

  c) Set the animation list with the duration of your liking like
     CustomBackground.setAnimationList(animationDrawableList, 5000)

  d) Set animation on the view with transition duration of your liking like
     CustomBackground.setAnimation(<view>, 2500)
